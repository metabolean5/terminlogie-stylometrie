WORKSHOP ON THE PASS


With LAURE NAVEAU



















-THE END(S) OF ANALYSIS IN THE TEACHING OF JACQUES LACAN-

































 PART 3: SYMPTOM AT THE END OF ANALYSIS


In our third workshop on the ends of analysis in the teaching of Lacan, we
will focus on the structure and place of the symptom at the end of
analysis. This year’s seminar will take place with a participation of our
eminent guest Laure Naveau, who will speak about her experience of the
pass, and Richard Klein and Bogdan Wolf. It is Laure Naveau’s and mine
wish, and we therefore encourage those interested in taking part in the
event, that we make ourselves familiar especially with the accounts of the
pass testimony by Laure Naveau already published as listed below. This
will allow us to impassion the day of work with an inquisitive
conversation consisting of contributions, comments and questions from all
sides.
Bogdan Wolf
