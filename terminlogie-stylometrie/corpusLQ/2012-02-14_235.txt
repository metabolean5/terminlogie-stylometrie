(Jacques Lacan Popular University)
To sign the Petition click here
The associations,
the professionals  involved, in various capacities, in the  reception, care and support of autistic children,
the parents whose children are received in medical or social-medical facilities,
the concerned citizens, french or not, all signatories of this petition:
–       demand that psychoanalysis, its research and practitioners cease to be defamed by allegations made to discredit them;
–       hope that the governments take into account the legitimate concern of families without however neglecting the work that for decades has been carried out by professional teams working with autistic children and adults in the areas of psychiatry, private practices and social-medical institutions. This work also benefits, in many cases, the practitioners’ psychoanalytic formation;
–       wish that the anxiety of families is not exploited to designate scapegoats, nor to denigrate professionals who are committed to promoting institutions and practises which ensure that the child and his or her family will be respected in their own subjective time;
–       consider that in France, the national representation will, in its wisdom,  avoid ruling on a public health problem which, far from being neglected, has for a long time been taken into consideration;
–       are calling for the establishment of a plan capable of ensuring the human and structural resources needed for the continuation of care and educational support that the unique situation of each child and adult suffering from autism requires.
